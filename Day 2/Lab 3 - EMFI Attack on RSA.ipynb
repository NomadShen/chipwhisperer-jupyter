    "## EMFI\n",
    "\n",
    "EMFI is another method glitching a target. It works by generating a large EM pulse by running current through a coil, which then induces voltages in the target. These voltages cause similar effects to voltage glitching, but has a few other faults it can cause. For example, EMFI can directly corrupt SRAM. EMFI has the advantage of being less invasive - there's no wires to solder or capacitors to remove. It has the disadvantage of introducing an additional complication - you need to position the EMFI probe in the correct spot over the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we'll use the PicoEMP to generate EMFI pulses. It's a pretty simple tool - there's an ARM button to arm the device and a PULSE button to fire the pulse. By default, there's no external triggering. While the lack of triggering wouldn't work for the password lab we did before, this doesn't pose a problem for this lab."

    "## Attack Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know, RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, meaning it has a public and private key, with one being used for encryption and the other for decryption. It can be used in both a public encryption/private decryption configuration and a private encryption/public decryption situation. We'll be attacking the latter case. Let's assume that the target is signing a message and is sending it to us so we can verify the identity of the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "For RSA, the public key is made up of two numbers, $n$ and $e$. The private key is made up of $n$ and $d$. These numbers have some special properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $n$ is constructed as the product of 2 prime numbers, $p$ and $q$.\n",
    "1. $d$ is derived from $p$, $q$, and $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of these properties, a few things are evident:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we learn $p$ or $q$, we can derive the other prime number since $n$ is public information.\n",
    "1. If we learn $p$ and $q$, we can derive $d$ since $e$ is public information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target can encrypt/sign a message with the following equation ($s$ is the signature and $m$ is the message):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = m^d({mod}\\space n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can decrypt/verify the message with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^e = m(mod\\space n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with RSA is that it's very slow - these equations are simple, but they use massive numbers; if the numbers used are too small, it's trivial for a computer to factor $n$ into $p$ and $q$. $n$ for the firmware we're attacking is 1024 bits long, which is on the smaller size of secure keys at this point. This encryption/signing operation is especially slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property of the signature verification equation is that the following is also true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(m - s^e)(mod\\space n) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "aka $(m - s^e)$ is divisible by $n$. It follows that $(m - s^e)$ is divisible by $p$ and $q$ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)\n",
    "\n",
    "To help speed up the encryption, an optimization known as the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) can be used. This theorem allows us derive two new exponents, $d_p$ and $d_q$, which are much smaller than $d$. We can then replace\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = m^d({mod}\\space n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with two equations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_1 = m^{d_p}(mod\\ p) \\\\\n",
    "s_2 = m^{d_q}(mod\\ q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s$ is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i_q = q^{-1}mod\\ p \\\\\n",
    "s = s_2 + q(i_q(s_1 - s_2)mod\\ p)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$s_1$ and $s_2$ can be combined into $s$ via CRT. Even though there's two modular exponentiations, this is still much faster since $d_p$ and $d_q$ are much smaller than $d$ and $p$ and $q$ are much smaller than $n$. This is the optimization that our target, which is using a slightly modified version of MBEDTLS (more on that in a bit), makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inserting a Fault\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that instead of everything going smoothly as above, a fault happens during the calculation of $s_2$, turning it into $s'_2$. $s_1$ and $s'_2$ will then be combined into $s'$. If that happens, a couple of things will be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When we go to verify the signature, it won't work: $s'^e \\neq m (mod\\ n)$. Concequently, $(m - s'^e)(mod\\space n) \\neq 0$, so $(m - s'^e)$ is not divisible by $n$\n",
    "1. Since $(m - s'^e)$ is not divisible by $n$, it cannot be divisible by both $p$ and $q$ anymore. Due to how the CRT works, it will still be divisible by $p$, but not by $q$. This can be expressed as $(m - s'^e) = pk$ for some integer $k$.  \n",
    "1. We now have $(m - s'^e) = pk$ and $n = pq$. This means that $p$ is simply the largest integer that cleanly divides both $n$ and $(m - s'^e)$, aka the greatest common denominator. Therefore, $p = gcd(m-s'^e, n)$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once we have $p$, we can compute $q = \\frac{n}{p}$ and $d$ via the rest of the RSA key generation algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The math is similar in the case that $s_1$ is faulted, with the only difference being that we recover $q$ at the end instead of $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TLDR\n",
    "\n",
    "The target is doing two long calculations, then combining them. If we fault either calculation, we can recover the device's RSA key via the corrupted signature!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firmware\n",
    "\n",
    "The firmware we're using for this lab is `simpleserial-rsa`. This is a super simple deployment of RSA. All this firmware does is sign a message using RSA, then send it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSA library we're using is MBEDTLS which has been modified to remove some fault protection. We'll talk more about the modification at the end of the lab.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hopefully you can see now why running RSA-CRT on a device like this is a bad idea. We mentioned earlier that the signing operation that our device is doing is much slower than the verification operation. As such, you may be wondering if a device could verify that the signature is correct before sending it out. The answer to this is yes! In fact, this is what the real MBEDTLS does. Of course, in theory you could also glitch past this verification step via a second glitch and the Husky does have the ability to generate multiple glitches at the same time, but this is a little too much for a 2 day course. There's thefore still a tradeoff here between speed and glitch resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also be wondering if there are fault attacks against other types of cryptography. The answer to this is yes! In fact, in our main `chipwhisperer-jupyter` repo, we've got a fairly practical AES fault attack (`courses/fault201/Lab 1_3` A and B). "
