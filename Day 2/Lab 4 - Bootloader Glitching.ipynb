    "As in earlier labs, we'll need to find suitable settings. This can be done with voltage or clock glitching, but this lab uses clock glitching. The following is roughly what is required of you:\n",

    "### Clock Glitching\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous labs, we'll be using clock glitching for this one, as it seems to work pretty well on this target. This doesn't change too much, as you'll still need to find a set of widths/offsets that work for your device. The setup will be a bit different (mostly using and different output setting and putting the glitch on the clock pin instead of the glitch transistors). One thing that will be different is that you won't have to stop part way to reduce the width range. You'll also probably see fewer resets than with voltage glitching.\n",

    "### Finding a Suitable Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous labs, we used a loop to calibrate our glitch. This obviously won't be available on this target. Instead, to calibrate our glitch, we'd like to use one of the bootloader operations. Ideally, this operation will allow us to identify if the device did one of the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reset\n",
    "2. Worked Normally (no effect)\n",
    "3. Was impacted but a glitch (success!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we don't want this operation to be very timing-dependant (i.e. you don't want to have to scan `ext_offset` very precisely).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the various functions in the bootloader and decide on what to attack. You'll need the op-code for the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up Normal Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup some code to operate the function normally. We'll use this as a bit of an oracle for understanding the normal output."
