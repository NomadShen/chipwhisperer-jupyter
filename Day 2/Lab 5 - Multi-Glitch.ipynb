    "# Lab 5 - Multi-glitch\n",
    "\n",
    "**SUMMARY:** *In this lab, we'll modify our original glitch loop to prevent glitched data from leaking from our target. After implementing these changes, we'll take a look at how we can use the Husky's new multi-glitch feature to break past the countermeasures*\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implementing countermeasures in firmware\n",
    "* Differentiating between partial success and normal glitch results\n",
    "* Using ChipWhisperer-Husky's multi-glitch feature\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying Firmware\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll be revisiting the `simpleserial-glitch` firmware from the first glitch lab we did. This code is pretty simple, so it's easy to modify. It's also fast, which means we can quickly try different glitch settings on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend that this loop calculation is actually using sensitive data and that, if this calculation is glitched, the sensitive data will leak. We'll also assume that the end value of the calculation can be verified, but that the firmware can't just send it out instead of doing the calculation. Sound familiar?\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by opening up `chipwhisperer/hardware/victims/firmware/simpleserial-glitch/simpleserial-glitch.c`. The change we're going to make to it is very simple: if we detect an incorrect calculation, we'll send out a series of 0's instead of the glitched value:\n",

    "        simpleserial_put('r', 4, (uint8_t*)&cnt);\n",
    "        return 0x00;\n",

    "Now, the firmware should avoid sending out glitched values. As you might've guessed, our goal for this lab will be to glitch both the loop and the subsequent check so that we still get the corrupted value back.\n",

    "One thing that you might've noticed about the firmware is that you can still tell when the loop is being glitched, even if we don't actually get the glitched value back. This is because the device still sends back an error code and a series of zeros. In fact, it's actually really hard for the target to hide this information - even if it redoes the calculation, we can still tell we got a glitch because it'll take longer for us to receive the result. We could also look at the power trace and see that the device is doing two calculations instead of one.\n",

    "`width`/`offset` are the same for each glitch, so we don't have to worry about that. We'll keep repeat at 1, so no need to worry about that as well. We'll also keep the first `ext_offset` value constant, so this is almost the same as doing a single glitch. You can see how to set `ext_offset` below. **Note that the second ext_offset is an offset from the first glitch, so `[100, 50]` will put glitches at an `ext_offset` of 100 and 150.**"
