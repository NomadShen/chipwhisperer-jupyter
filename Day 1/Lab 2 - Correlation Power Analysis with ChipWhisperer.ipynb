    "We'll proceed fairly quickly through this lab - our goal here is just to showcase the power of a CPA attack. We'll go into more detail about the attack in a later lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, we'll be using the `simpleserial-aes` firmware, located at `chipwhisperer/hardware/victims/firmware/simpleserial-aes`. `simpleserial` is a protocol that we use to transfer data to and from most of NewAE's target firmware. Documentation can be found at https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpleserial.html. There's no need to worry about most of that documentation - ChipWhisperer will take care of the details for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, the firmware mostly does two things - first, it allows us to set a key for the AES implementation. Our goal is to recover this key. It also lets us send plaintext to the target, which the target will then encrypt and send back to us. Note that while we know the key, we don't use it in our attack at all - we mostly just use it to see how well the attack is working in real time.\n",
